## Introduction

In this project, we aim to build a classifier to evaluate whether the contents of a video posted on YouTube can be used to predict which channel posted the video. We use the examples of CNN and Fox, which are commonly known as the most liberal and conservative channels and later perform sentiment analysis to analyse if there are a common set of words which differentiate the two.

## Results & Conclusion

While we are able to achieve a high classification performance (F-1 score) for the classification models we build, we could not conclude on a very common or meaningful set of words to differentiate between the content of the two channels.

## Next Steps

Running the model for a larger dataset and a targeted set of keywords in the video title. 

PS: Open to feedback and improvements
